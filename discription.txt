This experiment was about building a simple Employee Management System that runs directly in the command line using Node.js.
 Instead of using a database, we stored everything in an array and allowed the user to interact with the system step by step.
The application works like a mini menu-driven program where we can manage employees during a session.

Key features implemented:

Add a new employee by entering their Name and ID.

View a list of all employees stored in the array.

Remove an employee using their ID.

Exit the program whenever needed.

Learning Outcomes

Understood how to take user input interactively using the readline module.

Learned how to perform basic array operations (add, display, delete).

Practiced writing a menu-driven program in Node.js.

Gained confidence in handling in-memory data without databases.
